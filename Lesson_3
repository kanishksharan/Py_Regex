Creating Character Classes ([])
Earlier, we had a long discussion about [cr][23][dp][o2] and how it differs
from r2d2|c3po” In the following examples, we will show that
r2d2|c3po is more restrictive than [cr][23][dp][o2]:


>>> m = re.match('[cr][23][dp][o2]', 'c3po')# matches 'c3po'
>>> if m is not None: m.group()
...
'c3po'
>>> m = re.match('[cr][23][dp][o2]', 'c2do')# matches 'c2do'
>>> if m is not None: m.group()
...
'c2do'
>>> m = re.match('r2d2|c3po', 'c2do')# does not match 'c2do'
>>> if m is not None: m.group()
...
>>> m = re.match('r2d2|c3po', 'r2d2')# matches 'r2d2'
>>> if m is not None: m.group()
...
'r2d2'
